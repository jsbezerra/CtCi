Ruby solutions for [Cracking the Coding Interview 6th Edition](http://www.amazon.com/Cracking-Coding-Interview-6th-Edition/dp/0984782850) by [Gayle Laakmann McDowell](http://www.gayle.com/).

## Installation

```bash
$ rake install
```

## Usage

This project was created to implement solutions in Ruby for the problems in [Cracking the Coding Interview 6th Edition](http://www.amazon.com/Cracking-Coding-Interview-6th-Edition/dp/0984782850) during my personal studies.
It is by no means the only way the solutions could be implemented, nor it is guaranteed to be free of bugs or have the best possible solution (as much as that is the aim).

Feel free to contribute to it by proposing new test cases, offering alternative solutions and data structure implementations, reporting issues and/or bugs, or in any other way you see fit.
Remember to be kind, though: Criticism is welcome, Trolls are not!

Hope you have as much fun as I do :D
